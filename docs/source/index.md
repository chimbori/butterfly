# Butterfly Social

Self-hosted OpenGraph social link preview image generation tool.

Open source, fully customizable, yet works out of the box with minimal configuration.

Butterfly Social is a quick way to auto-generate OpenGraph link preview images in bulk for all your sites, without the use of a separate template editor or API integration at no cost.
The source of truth for the image data & design remains within your primary website, so you can use tools you are already familiar with & assets that are already well-integrated into your workflow.
